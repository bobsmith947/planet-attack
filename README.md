# Planet Attack

This is a Tetris-like puzzle game where the blocks fall towards the center of the screen, and you need to form a complete ring in order to clear blocks.

The app uses immersive fullscreen mode. You can pull down from the top of the screen, or pull up from the bottom of the screen in order to reveal the system bars.

We would like feedback on how the game layout itself looks and feels.
